# mariiaan-CmdPlay1.0-fixing
i fixed mariiaan cmdplay 1.0 because i dont know how to use their new ones (im just assuming they/them because i dont know their gender)
i deleted their old ffmpeg.exe because it is missing vulkan-1.dll. the new one i installed is on here 'https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases' i am using the ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip
